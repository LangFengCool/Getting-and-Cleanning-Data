Coursera Course Project

Preparations for the project: download the dataset and unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive

Set the folder as the working directory and run run_analysis.R

Use data <- read.table("Cleaned_TidyData.txt.txt") to read the data, this is the result dataset I uploaded. 

It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activiti
